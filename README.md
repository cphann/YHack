# Viberavin: See and Feel the Music!
# Target Users: Deaf and Hard of Hearing

Introducing Viberavin, a groundbreaking music player app designed for deaf and hard of hearing individuals. Our app revolutionizes music enjoyment by using audio analysis to translate music into vibrations, allowing users to feel the rhythm of their favorite tunes directly on their phones.

What sets Viberavin apart is its immersive experience. Not only does the app vibrate along with the beat and intensity of the music, but it also features a selection of fun and engaging 2D animations of characters dancing to the music. Users can choose their favorite characters to dance along, enhancing their musical experience like never before.

But we don't stop there. Viberavin is more than just a music player. We believe in empowering our users through customization and feedback. The app prompts users for feedback after each listening session, allowing them to adjust vibration intensity and other settings to tailor their experience. This personalized approach not only enhances user satisfaction but also educates them about the app's features and capabilities.

In addition, Viberavin goes beyond entertainment. We've integrated a Connect page that connects users with organizations for music-related projects. Companies can post project details, and users can apply directly through the app, streamlining the process and providing valuable opportunities for our community.

Our focus on accessibility doesn't end there. We're committed to inclusivity by incorporating features like color adjustments for different types of color blindness and other optimizations to enhance the user experience for all.

Join us in revolutionizing how deaf and hard of hearing individuals experience music. With Viberavin, everyone can feel the rhythm and connect with the music they love.

## Features

- **Visual Equalizer**: The app displays a visual representation of the music's frequency spectrum. Different colors or patterns can represent different frequencies, allowing users to "see" the music.
- **Vibrating Patterns**: The app uses haptic feedback to create tactile sensations that correspond to the rhythm and intensity of the music. Users can feel the beat and tempo through their device's vibrations. [Learn more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Vibration_API)
